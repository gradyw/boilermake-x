# swear.jar

 We have created an application version of the good old Swear Jar. A great way for the user to keep 
 track of their swearing habits. This flutter Application created through Android Studios uses the Speech_to_text 
 flutter plugin. This library is a great tool to convert audio recorded to text using specific speech
 recognition ability. The target cases for this plugin are commands and short phases, however we have
 managed to get it to record continuous spoken conversation.
